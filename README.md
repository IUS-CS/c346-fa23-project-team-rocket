# Life Simulator

Life Simulator is an interactive ecosystem simulation of the complex relationships between organisms in various ecosystems, including reproduction, death, hunger, and dynamic weather patterns. The ecosystem simulation is an innovative, immersive, and hands-on experience in which users can customize parameters like population sizes, species interactions, and weather patterns to simulate specific ecosystems and study the effects of different variables. The aim of Life Simulator is to bring the wonders of the natural world to users' fingertips and contribute to a greater understanding of our interconnected ecosystems.
