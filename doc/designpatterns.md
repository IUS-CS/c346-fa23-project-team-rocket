# Design Patterns

This file is intended to show which design patterns we're currently using, which patterns may be helpful, and how we plan to continue designing modules.

## Patterns Currently in Use

There are no OOP design patterns being used in our program currently.

## Possibly Helpful Patterns

Some patterns that may be helpful are:
* Singleton: The singleton is a design pattern that specifically ensures that no more then one object of the class exists. It also passes that object back when a client attempts to create a new object.
* Chain of Responsibility - Lets the client interact with the with a handler rather then directly processing requests. Requests are passed between handlers until one decides to handle the request.
* Builder - A director specifies an interface which calls a specific builder to produce a product object. This gives the director more control over the product via a builder interface. 

## Module Design Plans

For future design plans we'll likely be referring more often to websites like (OODesign.com)[https://www.oodesign.com/].
