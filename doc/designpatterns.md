# Design Patterns

This file is intended to show which design patterns we're currently using, which patterns may be helpful, and how we plan to continue designing modules.

## Patterns Currently in Use

There are no OOP design patterns being used in our program currently. Although we are using the Chain of Responsibility pattern in one of the features currently being developed.

## Possibly Helpful Patterns

Some patterns that may be helpful are:
* Singleton: The singleton is a design pattern that specifically ensures that no more then one object of the class exists. It also passes that object back when a client attempts to create a new object.
* Chain of Responsibility - Lets the client interact with the with a handler rather then directly processing requests. Requests are passed between handlers until one decides to handle the request.
* Builder - A director specifies an interface which calls a specific builder to produce a product object. This gives the director more control over the product via a builder interface. 

## Module Design Plans

During our module design process we'll be referring to proper pattern design and java references. We'll also take advantage of class and sequence diagrams to plan behavior before it's being implemented. Furthermore, we're implementing test-driven development into our processes.
