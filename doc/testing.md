# Testing Methodology

We are currently utilizing two different forms of testing to ensure that both the parts and the whole of our program are working as expected. We perform unit testing using Cucumber and JUnit and manually perform Integration testing. We also run our testing code on merges to ensure that Pull Requests properly pass all of our Unit Tests.


## Unit Testing
For our Unit Testing, we use the [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/) testing platform, which separates the test writing from the internal test definitions. A person can write the feature files in a near-plain text language called Gherkin, and then a developer can implement the background code needed for the 
tests to properly run and pass. Using this platform for our Unit Testing makes it simple to ensure that our testing checks normal and edge cases.
