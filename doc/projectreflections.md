# Project Reflections

This file outlines Team Rockets' experiences with the project. As such, since there are four members in our team, we'll divide the document into four sections so that each member can outline and elaborate on their personal experiences with the project.

I've had an interesting time with this project doing many different tasks, so I'll break them into sub-sections and then elaborate on my experiences in those sub-sections.

### Assorted Tools

One of the key tasks I did at the beginning of the project was setting up and debugging the Gradle build system we use and the cucumber testing platform we use. I previously didn't have much experience using either of those tools, so implementing and debugging that implementation gave me a lot of good experience with those tools. I also acquired some useful experience with other plugins and tools in IntelliJ, like the Profiling and Diagramming tools. Finally, I further increased my knowledge of GitHub and some of its integrated tools, like GitHub actions and how you can interface with those to create branch rules and merge restrictions.

### Project Management

I've done a lot of background administration and organization in this project. For example, I often plan out the meeting topics and lead the team through the meetings as well. While this has taken a good amount of time outside of the normal development work that I do, it's been rewarding, and I feel like it's given me some real-world experience on what it's like to take a leadership role for a small team of developers. I also learned how you can use chat and project organization software to organize meetings and work in a way that's easy to follow and understand.

### Development

Throughout this project, I feel like I've been improving my general development skills, whether by learning about different tools or things like Object Oriented Design Patterns. I've also learned more about writing proper tests and ensuring that when you write code, it's expandable and highly readable so that we can lower the amount of effort required for maintenance or new features. Of course, there can be problems caused by trying to overcomplicate things, and as such, I think that will likely be the next area where I improve my own ability.

### Documentation

One of the things I've been working on throughout this project is documentation, and it's really opened my eyes to how much documentation can be necessary for a project. On some previous projects I'd worked on, the amount of non-code documentation was very minimal, and looking back, that was a tremendous error that likely caused some of the issues I experienced in those projects later on. As such, having to write out all of these different documentation files and working with markdown has given me a newfound appreciation for writing good, clean, and readable documentation that goes over the intricacies of the project it's attached to.
