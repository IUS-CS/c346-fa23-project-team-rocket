# Proposal

Our project aims to develop an interactive ecosystem simulation software that simulates the complex relationships between organisms in various ecosystems, including reproduction, death, hunger, and dynamic weather patterns.

The ecosystem simulation is innovative, immersive, and hands-on, allowing users to explore ecological systems in a dynamic and customizable manner. It offers a realistic environment to observe the life cycles of various organisms and serves as a valuable learning experience, facilitating the understanding of ecological concepts. Users can customize parameters like population sizes, species interactions, and weather patterns to simulate specific ecosystems and study the effects of different variables.

This immersive, customizable, and educational experience benefits educators, students, researchers, and nature enthusiasts, fostering environmental awareness and enhancing ecological education. We aim to bring the wonders of the natural world to users' fingertips and contribute to a greater understanding of our interconnected ecosystems.
