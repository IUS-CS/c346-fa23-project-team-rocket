## Retro

### Good

* We made some good improvements to how the program was running
* Animal move finally being used
* We were able to highlight and work towards implementing a full feature with limited hiccoughs
* Improved testing and debugging
* We finally fixed and implemented some things we talked about for weeks

### Bad

* There was a lack of cohesion within the team and how work was getting implemented and accomplished
* There was an overestimation in what people could accomplish
* Some things were assigned to early as tasks
* Lack of communication among team members
* new features not being implemented into the simulation once completed 

### Actionable Commitments

As a team we will...

* Ensure that we're using the appropriate communication channels and responding to appropriate messages within a reasonable time frame
* Continue following our internal testing methodology and using them in a similar manner as we have been
* Endeavor to plot our sprint goals better and appropriate align tasks so that they allow for independent work without causing delays or issues
