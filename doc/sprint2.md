Date: 2023-10-10

Members present:

* Xavier Beatrice
* Dale Morris
* Jonathon Roberts
* Ryan Hurst
  
## Demo

This sprint, we completed:

* The designpatterns.md file
* The Map Class
* The one command test system
* Documented the previous sprint
* Added foxes
* Added Grass
* Added Terminal flags for some initial values
* Added AbstractOrganism, AbstractPlant
* Some important simulation changes
* Adding the base for the UI component

Here are screenshots of what we did:

## Retro

### Good

* More mindful of the implementation of our components and how they affect the system
* Started working before the last day
* meetings weren't as long 
* Performed more unit testing on the components
* Project structure starting to get more organized

### Bad

* Ineffective story point estimation
* Feature descriptions too vague
* Bad use of interfaces (I don't mean Java's Interfaces)
* Tried to implement too much in one sprint 
* Lack of clear process on what needs to be done when implementing something
* Had to wait for some people to get done before working on other things because program wasn't separated well enough

### Actionable Commitments

As a team we will...

* be more mindful in how we're estimating story points and be more conservative üêò in our assumptions
* limit our total story point count for sprint 3 to 20
* keep meetings as brief as possible
* continue performing proper testing
* being mindful of the overall architecture of the program
* continue not to delay work to the last minute
* better describe features and create more descriptive interfaces
