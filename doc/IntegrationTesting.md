### Overview

The integration testing process involves the manual testing and documentation of complex interactions between different components of the simulation system, the random chances of certain events, and the unpredictable outcomes. Due to the unpredictable nature of certain events and interactions, manual testing is necessary to ensure comprehensive coverage and accurate assessment of the system's behavior.

### Testing Procedure


1. **Define Test Scenarios**: Create test scenarios that cover a wide range of possible outcomes and interactions, considering both expected and unexpected behaviors.

3. **Manually Adjust Values**: Manually adjust input values and parameters for the simulation to test different scenarios and edge cases.

4. **Execute Simulations**: Run the simulation for each test scenario, carefully observing the behavior and outcomes of the system.

5. **Document Results**: Record the results of each test run, including any observed deviations, unexpected behavior, or issues encountered during the simulation.

6. **Analyze Data**: Analyze the data collected from the simulations, focusing on the interactions between organisms, random events, and the overall system behavior.

7. **Verify System Stability**: Verify that the system remains stable and consistent across multiple test runs, even with varying inputs and parameters.

8. **Note Anomalies and Edge Cases**: Document any anomalies, edge cases, or scenarios that require special attention or further investigation.

### Testing Template

Use the following template to record the results of each integration test:

---

#### Test Scenario: [Insert Test Scenario Description]

- **Input Values:** [Specify the input values and parameters used for the simulation]
- **Expected Outcome:** [Specify the expected behavior or outcome for the given scenario]
- **Observed Outcome:** [Document the actual behavior and output of the simulation]
- **Comments/Notes:** [Provide any additional comments, observations, or notes relevant to the test scenario]

### Conclusion

The manual integration testing process aims to ensure that the simulation system functions as expected, even in the presence of complex interactions and unpredictable events. By documenting the testing process and results thoroughly, we can identify any issues, anomalies, or edge cases that require further investigation or refinement.
