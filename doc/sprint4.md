* Added a github test action
* Wrote simulation unit tests
* Planned out an integration testing process
* Planned out a pathfinding system
* Added randomized organism placement from the terminal flag
* Wrote other assorted documentation files(retro and testing) 

Here are screenshots of what we did:

## Retro

### Good

* less meetings and they were shorter
* tasks were reasonable (personally)
* We did well with our time estimations for project components
* We've improved our documentation
* Meetings that occurred were succinct

### Bad

* We could've used another heads-up meeting
* Maybe overestimated story points a little (could've picked up a couple more tasks)

### Actionable Commitments

As a team we will...

* Keeping meetings succinct as possible
* Continue to make good conservative story-point judgements
* Continue writing decent documentation
